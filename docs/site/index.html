		<p>
		In the wake of the virus, storms, flooding, and subsequent chaos have radically transformed Washington, D.C. Explore a living open world full of diverse environments, from flooded urban areas to historic sites and landmarks, during one of the hottest summers in history. The streets have been overrun with enemy factions, each with its own agenda and each vying for control of DC. It will be up to you to liberate the city and protect what remains of society.
		</p>

		<article id="arti2">&nbsp;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege&copy;</article>
		<p>
		On the surface, Siege is classically Rainbow Six. It features a large, multinational who's who of special operators from various military organizations, seeking to fight a nebulous threat. It's a day-after-tomorrow setting where everything is somewhat recognizable but still high-tech enough to feel futuristic, which has been the Tom Clancy brand's calling card for years.

		<article id="arti3">&nbsp;GhostRunner&copy;</article>
		<p>
		Developed by Polish studio One More Level, Ghostrunner is one of the coolest post-apocalyptic games around. The action-platformer focuses on speed and leans into hardcore challenging gameplay. Everything in the game dies in one hit, including yourself. The best way to stay alive is to always be on the move with your arsenal of abilities that allow you to wall run, dash through the air, and more. The game sports a wide variety of dangerous enemies, all with their own strengths and weaknesses, which makes navigating levels a unique puzzle-like challenge. Hooked Gamers said in its review, “It’s rare to find a game that succeeds so well in everything it does, and the result is a game that absolutely everyone should check out.”
		</p>

		<article id="arti4">&nbsp;Overcooked 2&copy;</article>
		<p>
		Overcooked 2 is a chaotic co-op cooking game for 1-4 players in which you must serve a variety of recipes including sushi, pasta, cakes, burgers and burritos to hungry customers in a series of unconventional kitchens. Whether it be a hot air balloon, a magical Wizard’s school or even another planet, you’ll have to be bready for anything. Work solo or with up to three friends to prep orders while overcoming obstacles such as fire, collapsing floors, overbearing waiters and of course, the classic kitchen problem of floating work surfaces.
